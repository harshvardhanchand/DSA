program and data has to be brought in to main memory in order to be executed
data structures are formed in main memory and are then brought in to the execution memory
Commerical computer has a lot of memory and it is not possible to store all the data in main memory
Commercial data is stored in the form of files
Database means a collection of data arranged in a database
Data minning is the process of extracting data from a large amount of data
Static memory allocation is the process of allocating memory before the program is executed.
Heap memory should be treated as a resource that is allocated dynamically.
There are 2 types of data structures logical and physical in computer science.
physical data structures are those that are stored in the main memory like  arrays and linked list only.
They physically hold data
Logical data structures make use of physical data structures to store data.like stack and queue
Stack is a LIFO data structure
Queue is a FIFO data structure
Abstract data types are data types that are not defined in the program but are used in the program like int,float,char,string etc
O(1) is the time complexity of a constant time operation
O(log n) is the time complexity of a logarithmic time operation
O(n) is the time complexity of a linear time operation like using for loop to find sum of all the elements in an array
O is found out by the programmer by analysing code and procedure
Binary sort has a time complexity of O(n log n)
if no.of elements are constantly divided by 2 then its O(log n)
void swap(int *a,int *b)
{
    int temp;
    temp=*a; /1
    *a=*b; /1 
    *b=temp;/1
}
//hence complexity of above function is O(1) as f(n) = 3*n^0
int sum(int A[],int n)
{
    int i,sum=0;//1 sum =0
    for(i=0;i<n;i++) // i = 0 -1 i++ n+1
    {
        sum=sum+A[i]; //n
    }
    return sum;//1
}])
f(n )=2*n +3
//hence complexity of above function is O(n)
