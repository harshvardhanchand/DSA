static  variables in recursion
There are 5 types of recursion
1.Tail recursion
2.Head recursion
3.Tree recursion
4.Indirect recursion
5.Nested recursion
1.Tail recursion recursive call is always at the end of the function,only recursion is peformed at the end nothing else
recursion is time consuming, in most cases we are better off in terms of time complexity to convert tail recursion into a loop
2.Head recursion recursive call is always at the beginning of the function,only recursion is peformed at the beginning nothing else.
3.Tree recursion is when the recursion is performed in the middle of the function,recursion is peformed at the middle nothing else,more than one level of recursion.
4.Indirect recursion: multiple functions are calling each other becoming a cycle of functions calling each other
5.Nested recursion: a function is calling another function which is calling the first function.
